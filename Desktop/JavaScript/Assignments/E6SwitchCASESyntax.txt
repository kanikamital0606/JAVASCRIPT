The switch statement is used to perform different 
actions based on different conditions.

switch(expression) {
    case x:
        // code block
        break;
    case y:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
      // code block
}


This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
